The following project is a fork from https://github.com/educ8s/Cpp-Retro-Snake-Game-with-raylib. I have used the knowledge gained in raylib and game programming from the parent project
to create a maze game and a menu which binds them together nicely. The maze game generates random mazes. It takes the input for start and destination locations and creates a possible path
between them. The snake is then shown moving slowly block by block towards the destination.
